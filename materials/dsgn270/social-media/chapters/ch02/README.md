# The Business of Social Media
## Starting a Social Media Marketing Business
Local SM/DM businesses that are doing it right:
- [Jumping Elephant Digital Marketing](https://jumpingelephant.guru/): Sara Kirkpatrick's agency is a one-stop-shop for all digital marketing services.
- [Inbound Law Marketing](https://www.inboundlawmarketing.com/): Calin Yablonski used to have an agency similar to Sarah's but he has since "niched down" into digital services for law firms.

## Common Business Use Cases
- **Building a permission-based email list**: Although email is not generally considered "social media", an opt-in email list is transferrable to multiple platforms whereas follows, friends and connections are locked into individual social media platforms.
- **Customer Support**: [Social Media Customer Service 101: The Beginner's Guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-media-customer-service)
- **Education**: Closely related to communities of practice.
- **Influence Marketing**: use of endorsements and product mentions from influencers (individuals who have a dedicated social following and are viewed as experts within their niche).
- **Patreon (or similar) Promotion**: A popular revenue model with content producers relies on gift economics: quality content is produced free of charge but dedicated fans can support the producer with regular micro-payments starting at $1/month. Based on Kevin Kelly's [1000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) model.
- **Direct Sales**: Social media is often the first step in an online sales funnel that ends in a cart 
checkout process.
- **Targeted Advertising**: Most platforms offer pay-per-click ads that can be targeted by location and information provided by their FBI agent.
- **Brand Awareness**: A bit of a fuzzy term but has a big role in the social media campaigns of local businesses.

## Organic vs Paid Campaigns
- **Organic**: Using free tools provided by each social network to build a social community and interact with it, sharing posts and responding to customer comments.
  - Organic social media campaigns rely heavily on the production of content, whether it's a tweet, IG image or YouTube video. Who will provide and manage this content?
- **Pay-per-Click**: The easy way into social media returns - pay for ads. Most platforms offer a pay-per-click model where you only pay when a prospect clicks on your ad. This is often an "easy sell" for clients that can afford it because PPC:
  - Avoids the constant production of content required for organic campaigns.
  - Allows Return on Investment to be empirically tracked, tested and optimized.
