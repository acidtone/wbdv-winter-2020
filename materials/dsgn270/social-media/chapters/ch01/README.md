# Social Media: Content, Addiction and Mass Collaboration
## Terminology
- Community of practice: a group of people who share a craft or a profession.
- Social capital: the effective functioning of social groups through 
  - interpersonal relationships, 
  - a shared sense of identity, 
  - a shared understanding, 
  - shared norms and values, 
  - trust, cooperation, and reciprocity.

## Principles of Collaboration Collaboration
Collective volunteer effort toward a common goal can be categorized into three groups of increasing difficulty:
1. **Sharing**: the easiest form of effort because social tools allow us to share for free and there's often no oversight.
2. **Cooperation**: more difficult because it requires a change in behaviour to synchronize participants. Conversation is the first step toward cooperation and the creation of a group identity.
3. **Collaborative production**: the most difficult scenario happens when no one person can take credit for what gets created and the project could not happen without the participation of many.

## Broadcast vs Communications Media
Classic media production falls under two broad classifications:
- **Broadcast media**: One-to-many messaging. Examples include books, newspapers, radio, television, move theatres.
- **Communication media**: One-to-one conversations. Examples include: telegraph, phone, snail mail.

Social tools are like walkie-talkies: they do both.

### Publish --> Filter
The cost of classic media production is high. Publishing companies were created to decide what was worth printing because it was impossible to publish everything. These institutions filter, *then* they publish (all at a financial cost).

Social tools drop the price of publishing down to zero. It's now possible to publish everything. We just share whatever we want, whenever we want and we leave the filtering to somebody else. Filtering is Google's primary business model.

But how do we filter unlimited information?

### Classic filters
- **Time**: *when* the content is relevant. Example: evening time-slots in television.
- **Location**: *where* the content is relevant. This filter was removed when we began remote delivery of this program.
- **Classification**: *what* the content is. Tagging is a cooperative implementation of classification (kind of).

### Social filters
- **likes**: *who* likes the content.
- **up/down vote**: *who* thinks the content is credible.

## Breakout: Group charters
1. Break into the groups that were selected yesterday and create a group charter for Assignment 3 (group presentation):
    - Define the roles and responsibilities needed to complete the project.
    - Have each team member commit to a fair share of the work. A group member can be responsible for more than one job.
    - As a team, record these commitments in a group charter and make it available to the group.

2. Begin curating a list of candidate businesses to focus your presentation on.

## Trust and Credibility
In an environment of zero transaction cost, it takes less work to ask a question than to answer it. This places the burden of the conversation onto the answerer of the question but also raises the answerer's status in the community.

Participation builds trust and that trust results in group credibility. Sociologists measure trust in terms of social capital.

But who's putting in the most work? See [Institutions vs Collaboration](https://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_institutions_vs_collaboration) @ 6min.

## Mass amateurization of communities of practice
Use of these tools has resulted in the "mass amateurization" of classically professional media industries:
- journalism --> blogging, Titter
- photography --> Flicker, iStock, IG
- television --> YouTube, Twitch

This has also enabled the evolution of micro-niche learning communities that are no longer limited by geography and access to a means of production. Not always a good thing: See Shirky @ 16m55s regarding Pro-Ana.

## Lunchwork
Browse some websites that help people learn to code. Examples: Stack Overflow, css-tricks, reddit, wikipedia, etc.
- How are they publishing content?
- How are they filtering it?
- Do you see any examples of social filters that aren't listed above?

Describe their social media presence.
