# Assignment 3 - Social Media Analysis (Group Presentation)
You will be working in groups of 3-4.

Define a local (i.e. a geographical homophily) business segment or industry (which doesn't have to be located in Calgary) that has been greatly impacted (either positively or negatively) by COVID-19. 

Find an example of a business in this segment and analyze their online presence, specifically their use of social media.
- How were they impacted?
- How are they adapting to the situation? 
- What is the competition doing? 
- What broader lessons can be learned?
- As an independent contractor, how can these lessons be adapted services you can provide for your clients?

Your team will be making a 10 minute Zoom presentation on your findings this Wednesday afternoon.
