# Assignment 2: Homepage wireframes
Scenario: You've been hired by the [International Flipper Pinball Association](https://www.ifpapinball.com/) to redesign their website. They have asked you to bring some potential mockups for a responsive site with simplified navigation for the next meeting.

After reviewing their traffic analytics, you've identified the top features/content for desktop and mobile (the website isn't currently responsive):

## Desktop
1. World player rankings
2. Player search
3. Tournament listings

## Mobile
1. Player search
2. Offical tournament rules
3. World player rankings

## Instructions
Using graphic design software of your choice, create two storyboard wireframes of a redesigned home page; one for mobile (portrait) and another for desktop (landscape).

### Requirements:
- Include only the content and elements that would be visible when the site first loads. What are the key calls to action?
- Include three or more of the following mobile navigation structures in your mobile design:
  - Up button
  - Top tabs
  - Bottom navigation bar
  - Navigation drawer (aka hamburger menu)
    - Nested navigation
    - Expanding navigation drawer (aka accordion nav)
  - Call to action button
- Use comments to explain anything that isn't completely obvious.
  - What happens when I click that weird icon?
  - Does the navigation drawer slide open or fade in?
  - What happens if I scroll?
- Avoid using images (your editing tool should have placeholder icons for images) or colour in your wireframes. The goal is to discuss navigation and user experience and not get caught up in the design.
- Strive for clean lines in your wireframe. For example, borders for a header should connect cleanly with the border of the viewport.

## Submission Instructions
You will be submitting your assignment as .png or .pdf files.
1. In your 'wbdv-assignments' repo save your files to this location: `/dsgn270/a2/`
4. In addition, zip your .png/pdf files and upload them to the dropbox on Brightspace. Include a link to your repo as comment on your upload.

## Marking Rubric
Assignment 2: 40 points
- **10 points: Wireframe Presentation** - Your 2 storyboard wireframes (mobile, desktop) look professional in quality and are in .png or .pdf format, exported from an editor of your choice. Wireframes are in grayscale and there are no colors or real images. Icons can be real or placholders.

- **10 points: Mobile Redesign** - The mobile wireframe includes three or more mobile navigation structures and have navigation parity (the same navigation elements are available, even if in a different form) with the desktop wireframe.
- **10 points: Comments** - Comments are used on wireframes to further explain design decisions, page elements and consequences of user action.
