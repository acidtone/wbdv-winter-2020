## Tool Time  Activity: Deploy a website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
1. Create a new public repo called '*username*.github.io', where *username* is your github username.
  - be sure to check '*Initialize this repository with a README*'
2. You be forwarded to your repo home page. Click on '*Upload files*'.
3. Drag and drop (or menu select) the files from the website template you downloaded on Day 0.
  - Note: only 100 files can be uploaded at a time. Either break your files up into multiple uploads or remove files that aren't needed (such as any sass folders)
4. Once the files have uploaded, Commit these additions to your repo at the bottom of the page (extended description not needed). 
5. Wait a few minutes and browse to `https://username.github.io`, where '*username*' is (you guessed it) your GH username.

#### Mobile Nav Structures
- Up button
- Back button
- Top tabs
- Bottom navigation bar
- Navigation drawer
  - Nested navigation
  - Expanding navigation drawer
  - Embedded navigation
- Floating action button
- Gestural navigation

#### Navigation and Flow
- Allow users to browse your content before asking them for personal information
- Don't let the promotion steal the show
- Ask for permissions in context
  - Example: ask for location permissions after they've entered a search term for a store location
- Create key calls-to-action
- Organize and label menu categories to be user friendly
- Provide text labels to clarify visual information 
- Be responsive with visual feedback so that users know the results of their actions

## Activity: Mobile Websites
- Visit a few different websites on mobile and desktop. Include your Github Pages website.
- How long does the site take to load?
- Are you prompted to download a native app? How is the prompt displayed?
- Look at different parts of the site and look at
what works well and what doesn't work well.
  - Does the site have any mobile-centric navigation, like up buttons or a bottom navigation bar?
  - Does the site ask for any permissions such as notifications or location? When are these prompts displayed?
  - Is there content parity (the same content on both sites) across mobile and desktop? If not, is there an option to view the 'Full Site'?
- Can you find any examples of Progressive Web Apps?
