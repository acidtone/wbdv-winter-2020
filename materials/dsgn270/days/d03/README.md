## Tool Time: Git and Cmder
Install Git and Commandr onto your system if you already haven't. We'll need these tomorrow.

## Search Tips Reviewed
- convergent searches
    1. Be brief: try to reduce your search query to four words or less.
        - Note: there are many times you will break this rule such as when you search an error (you're searching errors, right?) or when you need extra terms to make your query domain-specific (see next step!).
    2. Make your search domain-specific (aka industry specific). "heading" could mean a number of different things, depending on context. "html heading" focuses your search to the web design *domain*.
    3. Qualify your search with terms specific to your needs and skill level. These terms are often reused for many searches. Examples:
        - tutorial
        - cheatsheet
        - checklist
        - review
        - documentation
- divergent searches
    1. Access your engine's *suggestion* results by appending "vs" the end of your query. This is handy for finding alternatives to a specific tool/technique/philosophy.

    If suggestions exist (ie you're using Google) but the results disappear for a search, you probably used too many words; Google seems to only index simple phrases.

## Waterfall
The article [Web design workflow: What to expect when starting a website project](https://blog.tbhcreative.com/2015/12/what-to-expect-website-design-workflow.html) is one of maaaany that breakdown the steps in a waterfall development workflow:
- First contact
- Discovery
  - Are we supporting IE?
  - Do you have analytics?
- Content design
  - content inventory
  - Information Architecture
  - Site map
- Wireframing
  - Two methods:
      1. full page wireframe
      2. storyboard wireframe (wireframing only what's in the viewport). See [Designing for a Viewport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY3lTBZnJmE) for the inspiration behind this method.
- Mockups
- Prototyping
- Development
- Testing
- Launch
- Fires
- Long-term support

### The 3 Elephants in the Room
1. Budget
2. Timeline
3. Milestones

## Assignment 2: Homepage wireframes
See the [Assignment 2 readme](../../assignments/assignment-2/README.md) for details.

**Due Friday @ 8PM**

## Tool Time: Wireframe editor
Assignment 2 is a research and self-learning assignment. This course is mostly tool agnostic. For example, you don't have to use VS Code; there are many professional alternatives available.

The current industry-standard wireframe and mockup software package is Sketch (which as only [recently had a Windows version](https://uxplanet.org/the-long-awaited-sketch-for-windows-comes-from-an-indie-team-2fc94309399c), kinda) BUT there are two or three signifcant competitors. 

Using your razor-sharp search skills, find the top three free-ish Sketch alternatives. Find system requirements, reviews and comparison articles to decide which you'll install and play around with (all of them?).

## agile
A professional alternative to waterfall. It comes in many flavours but here are three we'll talk about:
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Lean
