# Assignment 3: Login and Registration

Build two splash pages (no content that requires scrolling)

## Page 1 that contains:
- a logo (can be generic font icon or similar graphic)
- login fields: username, password, submit inputs
  - action -> '#'
  - method -> post
  - overlapping elements (either using grid or absolute/relative positioning)
  - a 'Register' link (that looks like a button) to Page 2

## Page 2 that contains:
- registration form (all required unless otherwise specified)
  - action -> '#'
  - method -> post 
  - username
  - email
  - phone number (optional)
  - password
  - confirm password
  - file upload for profile pic
- instructions/directions
  - instructions to fill out form
  - password strength guidelines (i.e. length, required symbols, etc)
  - which fields are mandatory?
## General Requirements
- both pages should include global navigation for the Login and Register links
- both forms should be accessible
- all code should validate
- All CSS should be in an external stylesheet(s)

## Marking Rubric: Three marks will be given for each of the following:
1. Are the HTML and CSS of the two pages properly organized and do the files validate?
2. Are the forms properly constructed (correct input types, options, etc)?
3. Are the forms accessible?
4. Presentation: are custom colours and fonts used? Are the buttons and layout aesthetically pleasing?
5. Is the page responsive? Is there an example of elements overlapping?
