# Single page Portfolio Website - 35%
- Due: Sunday, Feb 2 @ 8PM
- Value: 35% of final course mark

For your final project, you will create your own portfolio website. Marking for this project based on the following:

## Deliverables
This project should have a minimum of four sections, linked internally using a "global nav". The names and goals of the sections are up to you but each of the following must be included in the page:

- Hero section with either a background image or colour scheme;
- Global navigation (a nav bar that links to each section);
  - if the menu is too large for the width of the page, replace it with a "hamburger menu" or similar pattern. it does not have to be operable (difficult to do without javascript) 
- At least two different styles of "cards" (i.e. search the card pattern in responsive design)
- At least one content band that holds either 1x3 or 1x4 cards;
- A gallery of 5 or more images using either flexbox or css grid;
  - this is separate from the content band above but can use one of the card formats
  - images should either be original works by you or openly licensed images that relate to your portfolio.
- One page of "long format" text like an About section or blog post that contains original content and at least:
  - one heading
  - 50 words of text
  - one image (using an img tag, not a background image)
- One email contact form:
  - this must have the following inputs
    - Name
    - Email
    - Message
  - use a free third-party form submission service to make your form operable

## General
- All code must validate;
- Nav must include a logo (can be an icon font, formatted text or similar graphic);
- Must include at least two social icons of your choice;
- Site must be responsive;
- This portfolio does not have to be tech or programming based. It can be based on hobbies, past career work, etc. You will not be marked on the content itself, only the code and design principles used to present it.

## Submission Requirements

Please zip all files required for the site to operate and upload to Brightspace. Also, push this assignment to your `wbdv-assignments` repo to the directory `cpnt260/final`.
