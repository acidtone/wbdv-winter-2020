# Activity: Progressive Enhancement
Extend [`hero-starter.html`](hero-starter.html) by adding a new `section` of content containing one of the `clip-path` examples from yesterday.

## Questions to ask
- is the section responsive?
- what's the experience without `clip-path`? `shape-outside`?
- are there any other newish features that might be a problem in older browsers?
