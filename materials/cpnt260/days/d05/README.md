## Tool Time: Code organization
- main.css (naming alternatives exist)
  - reset.css
  - fonts.css
  - colour.css
- `style` == scratch pad
  - when you're happy with today's code, move your embedded css into a forms.css (or whatever) file
- optional: push your fave css files to GH Pages and link to them with an absolute url

### Anatomy of a form
- form container
  - method
    - get
      - variables listed after the ? in the url
    - post
      - variables sent in a separate header
      - used when encryption is needed or you want clean urls
      - OR you're using proper CRUD
  - action
  - `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
    - needed when you're uploading a file
- input types (see [complete list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input))
- text based fields
  - text
  - password
  - phone
  - email
  - textarea
- selection fields
  - one of many
    - radio buttons
      - grouped by the `name` attribute value 
    - menu select
  - one or more of many
    - checkbox
      - nameing your checkboxes `name[]` creates a list on the server side
    - multi-select
- special fields
  - file upload
    - enctype required
  - range
  - color picker
- hidden fields

### Activity: Over-18 button
Head out of the gutter! Many industries (ex. brewery/cannabis in Canada) are legally required to have a splash page with a click-through "agreement" that you're over the age of 18. Build the button:
- must be an operable form
- use a proper form submit input instead of a button
- center the form button horizontally and vertically on the page
- try styling your button using:
  - `background-color` and `color`
  - `border`
  - `border-radius`
  - `:hover` selector
  - `box-shadow`
- bonus: build the button as a label/input:checkbox pair. Hint, an input with `display: none` can still be checked/unchecked using its label. Have the background of the label change when the input is checked.

### Considerations with forms
- accessbility
  - fieldset and legend
  - labels
  - layout
- placeholders
- modification attributes
  - required
  - disabled
  - pattern
- adjacent and sibling selectors
- :checked pseudo-selector
- attr()
- sprite sheets

## Flexbox vs Grid Forms, Neither?
- html structure considerations
- browser support
- usability
