# Responsive Form: Desktop First
## Instructions
Using your knowledge of grid and media queries, modify the layout for mobile (width less than 500px?) in form-starter.html:
- form width is 75vw
- field labels are placed directly above their respective inputs
- while you're at it, make the submit button pretty and full card width on mobile
- You may not change existing html or css
