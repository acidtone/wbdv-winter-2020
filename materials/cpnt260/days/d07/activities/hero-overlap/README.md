# Activity: Overlapping Text
Try building a hero section using whitespace and overlap. 
- [Example](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2018/12/TimesTalk-e1543915669907.png) ([Source](https://thenextweb.com/creative/2018/12/19/10-exciting-web-design-trends-you-2019/))
- Instead of a full width image, try adding whitespace
- In the negative space, add text and overlap it with the image (be careful to keep text readable)
