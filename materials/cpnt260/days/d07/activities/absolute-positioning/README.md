# Activity: Absolute positioning
Use absolute positioning to place the smiley icon in `smiley-starter.html` so that it matches [this screencap](screencap.png).
- icon should move with the box when the window changes size

## Questions to ask:
- What element should the icon be positioned to? IOW, what element should have `position: relative`?
- what happens if you change the position (using `top`, `right`, etc) of the relatively placed element?
