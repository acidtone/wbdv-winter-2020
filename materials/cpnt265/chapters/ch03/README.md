# SEO
## What Is Seo?
- Methods, principles, and techniques used by people to organically
rank their web pages in search results

## Seo Factors 
### On-Page SEO
- Any type of search engine optimization that is done on the page. 
  - Structuring URLs, adding alt text to images, using keywords in your content, posting new content regularly
### Off-Page SEO
- Any kind of optimization that is done off the page
  - Guest blogging, link building, social media, content marketing

## Seo Best Practices
- Get Google to trust your website
  - Provide Value (content, content, content) 
  - Build Trust
    - age (age of domain, how fresh is your content) 
    - authority (trusted websites link back to us)

## The Algorithm
Google changes its algorithm often so that low quality sites can't "beat the system" and rank high on search results.

## Some Algorithm Updates In 2018
- Page speed became a ranking factor for mobile results (July 9, 2018)
- Google changed snippets (meta descriptions) shown on search results page to have a max limit of 150-160 characters (May 13, 2018)
- Mobile versions of websites (instead of desktop) are used to rank pages (March 26, 2018)

## Black Hat Seo
Practices that go against SEO guidelines in order to get a site ranking higher in search results.
- keyword stuffing
- cloaking
- using private link networks

### KEYWORD STUFFING
Filling your content with irrelevant keywords to manipulate page
rank.
- lists of phone numbers without substantial added value
- blocks of text listing cities and states a web page is trying to rank for
- repeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural

“We are in the business of selling **web development software**. **Web development software** is what we sell. If you are thinking of getting **web development software** get in touch with one of our **web development software** consultants.”

### CLOAKING
Showing one piece of content to users and a different piece of
content to search engines.

Treat search engine crawlers the same as your human visitors.

### Sneaky Redirects
Sending a visitor to a different URL than the one they initially clicked on.
- Redirects have a purpose and are supposed to help visitors, not confuse or lie to them

### Link Exchanges
Link exchanges used to be common SEO practice, but are now
usually a sign of Black Hat SEO.
- They don't help your rankings as much as one-way links. 
- Usually just a list of links and rarely actually relevant.

## How To Do Keyword Research For Seo

### Step 1: Make A List Of Important, Relevant Topics
- Come up with 5-10 topics you think are important to the business. 
- What topics do you want to rank for in search results?
- What do you blog about?
- What topics come up most often in sales conversations?

"web design", "custom CSS", "WordPress", "business", "developer collaboration", "blogging", "e-commerce"

## Step 2: Fill In Those Topics With Keywords
"web design"
- web design inspiration
- web design tips
- web design layout
- web design tutorials
- web design trends
- WordPress web design
- responsive web design
- how to tell if you need a new web design web design tools
- how to create a winning web design how to find a good web designer  

## Step 3: Research Related Search Terms

## STEP 4: CHECK FOR A MIX OF HEAD TERMS AND LONG-TAIL KEYWORDS
- **head terms**: keyword phrases that are generally shorter and more generic (1-3 words in length)
- **long-tail keywords**: phrases that contain 3 or more words

"web design" vs "how to optimize your web design"

## Step 5: Check Out The Competition
Use tools like https://www.semrush.com/ and https://serpstat.com/
to see what keywords your competition is ranking for

## Step 6: Focus On Specific Keywords 
Use Tools Like:
- https://moz.com/explorer/ 
- https://trends.google.com/trends/ 
- https://www.google.com/trends/correlate

These will help you see how well a keyword is doing and whether or not it's worth trying to rank for.

## Step 7: Adding Keywords To Your Content
1. Heading Tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
2. `<title></title>`
3. Throughout content
4. `<strong></strong>`
5. text in links
6. image filenames

### CALCULATING ROI

## How Do Websites Generate Revenue

## COPYRIGHT
### TIP #1
Make sure you have the right to use every piece of content when
developing the website.
- Text 
- Images

## TIP #2
Add a clause to your contract.
>“You guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

        @media print {
          h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {

          }

            page-break-before: always; // Always start new articles on a new page
          }

          } 
        }

        }
