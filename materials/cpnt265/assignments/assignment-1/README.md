# Assignment 1: E-commerce Business Justification
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to research and analyze the options available for an e-Commerce application for a small business and develop a business justification document for the application. This project will be completed in groups of 3-4 and handed in as a PDF proposal to the hypothetical client (or investors if you've chosen your own startup).

## Directions
Working in teams of 3 or 4 (depending on class-size), you will develop a business justification for building an e-commerce application for a small business.

## Group Charter
Assign the key roles and responsibilities for each group member in delivering the project for Assignments 1 and 2. After each entry write a short summary defining their role and what their responsibilities are in the project. This charter will serve as the reference for any group mediation that is required.

### Potential Roles
  - research
  - copy writing
  - frontend dev (be specific)
  - backend dev (be specific)
  - graphics
  - devops
  - etc

## Requirements
- Select a small business that can be your client for the exercise. It could be an actual business, or your team could decide to define an entrepreneurial venture to sell products or services online.
- Research the models and options available for designing, developing and hosting the application. 
- Ensure that each team member participates in the preparation of the presentation and that each person has an equal part in the presentation itself. One of the goals of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to practice delivering a presentation in front of an audience.

The following is a list of things to consider when determining what type of E-Commerce site would be best for your chosen company. Please discuss each of these items during your presentation.

- Determine what kind of model would best suit the business.
- Are you working with an existing business or starting a new online business?
- If the business already exists, will it be a mixture of physical store-front and online sales, or switch to only online selling?
- Determine whether you will be selling products or services. If you are selling products, are they physical or digital? What kind of distribution infrastructure will be needed? Does the company already have the infrastructure, or will it have to be built?
- Discuss the target market. Are they reachable online? Are they local or global? How will you market to them? Are there any new markets that havenâ€™t been reached before?
- Will you use a hosting service or self-host? Does the company have the infrastructure for this, or do you have to build it?
- What other issues can your team identify?
