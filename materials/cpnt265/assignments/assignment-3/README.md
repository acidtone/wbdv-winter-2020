# Portfolio Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to create your online presence and portfolio.

## Portfolio Advice from our recent Industry Advisory:
Potential employers are interested in your perspective - how you think, how your mind works
- Do out-of-class research on a framework/project
- Write a report on it that critiques it and/or talks about your perspective and opinion of it, and any challenges you ran into with it
- Showcase a small project you did with it - create a dynamic GUI using data from a JSON API or REST Service
that you integrated your site with. Some open APIs can be found here:
