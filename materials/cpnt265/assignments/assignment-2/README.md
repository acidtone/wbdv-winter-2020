# Build a Shopping Cart
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to set up and configure the e-commerce site you proposed in Assignment 1. You will continue working in your groups. 

## Directions
Design, configure and deploy an online e-commerce site for the small business you presented during the Business Justification assignment. This may either be a self-hosted solution or an online service.

## Requirements
1. Find graphics for at least 5 products and set the products up in the catalogue. Make up your own descriptions and pricing.
2. Clean the demo products out of the installation.
3. The business wants to be able to ship (if physical delivery is applicable) across Canada, the United States and Mexico, providing same-day service, 1-2 week, and 3-6 week delivery options with a flat rate for each. Make up your prices, but Canada will be the cheapest, the U.S. will be higher and Mexico will be the highest.
4. Set up the payment modules to accept PayPal, Visa and Mastercard (if applicable).
5. Set up the tax regions so that Alberta shoppers do not pay any provincial sales tax, but all Canadian shoppers pay the GST. For the United States and Mexico, there will be no sales tax added.
6. Since the store wants to do business in Canada, the United States and Mexico, ensure that these three currencies will be accepted.
7. Additional Configuration:
  - Set the store up with a custom logo.
  - Alter the colour scheme or use a custom theme. 
  - Ensure that customers can post product reviews.
  - Add any extra customizations that you feel are applicable.
