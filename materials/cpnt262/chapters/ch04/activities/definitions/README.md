# Activity: Return Definition by slug
Use the definitions object from yesterday:
1. For each definition, add a property that equals a URL-formatted version of the term. Example: Execution Context -> `execution-context`
2. Add middleware that returns a specific definition based on the slug passed in the request URL: /definitions/:slug
