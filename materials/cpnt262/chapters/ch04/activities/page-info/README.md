# Activity: Endpoints for Pages
Use the pageInfo.js file for this activity
1. For each page, define a GET endpoint handler that returns only the information for that page.

For example: the URL '/' would send the following JSON from pageIndo.js
```
{
  title: 'Home Page',
  description: 'Welcome!'
}
```
