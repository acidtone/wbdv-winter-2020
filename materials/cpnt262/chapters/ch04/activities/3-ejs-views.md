# Activity: Convert public/html files -> views/ejs
You should have a public folder in your EJS app that contains html files. Convert each html file into an ejs template by:

1. Create a 'views' folder in the same folder as your app.js file.
2. Copy each html file from your public directory to your new views directory.
3. Change the file extension of your new 'views' files from .html to .ejs
4. Create get endpoints for each view and render them.

Test your app. It should behave the same way as the public/html version did.
