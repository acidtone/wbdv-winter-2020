# MongoDB: Practicing CRUD methods
Let's practice CRUD with mongoDB. Zell Liew has a great article/tutorial on [creating a CRUD application with Express and MongoDB](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/).

These instructions are taken from the README in his [finished code](https://github.com/zellwk/crud-express-mongo) (see [demo](https://crud-express-mongo.herokuapp.com/))

## Instructions
1. Clone [repo](https://github.com/zellwk/crud-express-mongo)
2. run `$ npm install` to install dependencies
3. Refactor his code for your own project:
    - Install dotenv and store connection details in a .env file
    - Change connection details to match your own MongoDB Atlas db and collections.
    - Get his code running as-is on your own system using MongoDB Atlas.
    - Adapt his code to suit your requirements. This example revolves around Star Wars quotes (collection == 'quotes'). Try refactoring this code around an image `gallery` collection.
