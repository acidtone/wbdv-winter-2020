# CPNT 262: Chapter 1
## Gotchas if not using Docker or Vagrant

## Javascript Review
- names
- primitives values
- declaration, assignment, and undefined
- operator functions and expressions
- comparison operator
- objects
- object syntax

### Activity 1: Functions
Write a function that combines the behaviour of two or more operators. For example: `timesTwoPlusOne(arg1,arg2)`
  - What does `console.log()` print when you return a value with the `return` keyword?
  - What does `console.log()` print when you don't?
  - What does `console.log()` print when you don't include the paranthesis? For example: `console.log(timesTwoPlusOne)`
  - In your code, find an example of each of the following:
    - name
    - value
    - expression
