Farrah Kohorst joined Kahane Law in March 2014 and is currently an associate with Kahane Law Office.

Farrah's approach to Family Law files is to be as kind as you can for as long as you can and try to negotiate a settlement which takes into account the needs and desires of all involved. When negotiation does not appear to be working and a fair settlement is not on the table then prepare and litigate quickly and effectively. She sees an incredible amount of value in having client�s work together, with lawyer assistance if needed, to settle their own issues, but feels it is very important to have litigation as an available resource as sometimes that is the only route available to obtaining what your client really needs.
Farrah has practiced exclusively in the areas of Family law since her call to the bar in 2008. She is very passionate about obtaining the best possible results for her client and their family and has a substantial amount of experience dealing with all issues associated with common law separations and divorces. She also is an advocate for cohabitation and prenuptial agreements and is regularly negotiating and completing these contracts for her clients.
Farrah is a trained mediator and is available for these services. She does not complete adoptions or take on mobility files.

Labour and Employment Lawyer, Kim Nutz holds a Bachelor of Arts in American History and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Calgary (1999). She was admitted to the Alberta bar in 2000 and initially articled at a small criminal defence firm. After completing her articles, Kim moved to a large national firm as an associate lawyer for 6 years where she began working and specializing in labour & employment law and commercial litigation. She then joined the City of Calgary as legal counsel to the Calgary Fire Department further specializing in labour & employment law and spent a short time at Suncor Energy in their law department.

Kim practices primarily in the area of labour and employment law representing both employees and employers. As a labour & employment lawyer, Kim�s practice includes working with employers and employees in wrongful termination matters and human rights disputes. She drafts and reviews severance packages and employment agreements, conducts and advises on workplace investigations (including OHS post incident investigations), and assists employers to develop workplace policies to comply with occupational health and safety, employment standards, privacy and human rights legislation. Kim helps clients know the difference between minimum standards and what is really required under the common law with respect to employment law.
When acting for a terminated employee, Kim offers a flat rate fee for the severance review and if deemed necessary, after the review is complete, will further act on behalf of the employee on a contingency basis for negotiations on the severance package. This means that the client will only pay the upfront flat fee plus the contingency fee on any increase negotiated on the severance package they ultimately receive. This limits a person�s risk at a time when finances may be of greater concern.
Additionally, Kim can assist in any real estate purchase, sale or refinance transactions and is also a licensed mortgage broker. In her spare time, Kim is also a wife and mom to two great kids!
