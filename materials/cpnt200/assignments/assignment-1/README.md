# Assignment 1: Jekyll
## Purpose
This task helps you become more familiar with the fundamentals of static website generators. You will be creating/configuring a number of common blog/cms features such as pages, posts, dynamic navigation and items (using collections). This site can be hosted on [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or a static web host such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Directions
Using the Jekyll framework, generate a static website that is either:

- Your own portfolio site.
- A hypothetical client site for a business owner of your choice.
- A brochure-ware website for a law firm based on the content provided in [`starter`](starter).

Use your own unique content where possible. Place holder content is permissible with proper attribution and integration into your project. 

**Lorem ipsum text and Lorem Picsum placeholder images cannot be used for this assignment.** Adapt existing, openly licensed content for your design and use static images (can be remotely hosted) when practical.

**You cannot use any installed or 3rd party themes for this project.** You may use auto-generated pages and directories that come with the `jekyll new` command (minus the theme).

## Deliverables and Rubric
5 points will be given to each of the following deliverables:

### 1. Code Quality
Your code should be valid, well formatted/organized and easy for your instructor to find the things while marking.

### 2. Usability
- accessibility
- layout 
- user experience
- presentation
- responsiveness

### 3. Page Structure

### 5. Posts
- See instructions for post content expectations.

- Create a Posts page that lists excerpts of each post (pagination not required). Each post should contain a link to the full post (see below).
- Create a single post page for displaying a single (you guessed it) post in its entirety.
- Posts should have valid Jekyll filenames with publish dates.

### 6. Collections
- Present an example of a Collection in your site
