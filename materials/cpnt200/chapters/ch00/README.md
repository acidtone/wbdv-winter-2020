## Tool Time
### Slack
- Search: [Top Slack Features](https://www.google.com/search?q=top+slack+features)
- Things to remember about the Slack free plan
  - Messages are deleted eventually (after 2 weeks?) so find a more permanent solution for useful Slack content.
  - Video conferencing is not available but one-on-one videos are possible.
  - Limit of 10 App integrations

### Zoom
- Video Search: [Zoom Tutorial](https://www.google.com/search?q=zoom+tutorial&tbm=vid)
  - [How To Use Zoom (plus Breakout Groups)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i-NA563Ojk) by George Kao

### Google Drive
- Article: [Google Drive for Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/205875058-Google-Drive-for-Slack)

### GitHub
- GitHub Slack Integration
  - [Slack + GitHub](https://slack.github.com/)
  - [GH Slack Integration Repo](https://github.com/integrations/slack) (posted mostly for the documentation)

### Project Management
Popular options:
- [Trello](https://trello.com/)
  - Popular tool based on Kan-Ban 
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)
  - An old-school PM app but still worth checking out
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  - Enterprise-level PM; probably overkill for our uses.
- Search "Trello vs" for more potential alternatives. Pay attention to group collaboration features.

## Activities
- Build/Refactor a static 3-4 page version of your portfolio website. Add placeholders for a blog with five posts.
- Create your own Zoom account and try hosting a meeting. This will come in handy during the group work.
- Connect your Google Drive account to your Slack account (IF you plan on posting Google Drive Links)
- Try out some online Project Management platforms in anticipation of group projects. Each group will decide on a platform to use for any given project. Begin forming an opinion on which you prefer. Start by researching the group collaboration features of each alternative.
- Slack localization: if English is your second/third/whatever language, research ways to translate content into your native language.
